Subject: Re: qmail-rblchk

I´ve made the follwing test with 300000 users and 500000 mails (60% SPAM mails, 
40% standard mails) on a Sun Enterprise 6500 System with 4x450 Mhz CPUs and 4 GB 
RAM on a Midrange SAN Storage Device:

Every user gets the following configuration:

.qmail:
|condredirect <user>-spam qmail-rblchk -c -n 127.0.0.1 -s rbl.local.test

.qmail-spam:
/home/<user>/Maildir/.UCE/

So every mail from RBL listed IPs will be moved into the SPAM folder.

qmail-rblchk works fine with all test mails. There was no problem. So i would 
say, that qmail-rblchk could be used in production enviroments without risk.
